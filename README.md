# Distributed Network Verifier
The goal here is to make a tool that can verify a web request actually happened.


# Design
- tool to record request
    - make new private key?
    - make 
- tool to verify recorded request is valid
- heckin' blockchainerino


# Presentation
- bring up how consensus wouldn't work
- sadly using asymmetric encryption to verify parties isn't mainstream, since no standard -> hard to solve
- fortunately TLS gives "robust" verification, at least for big players
- show tool that can verify and solve these blocks
- use TLS + proof of stake to record individual blocks
